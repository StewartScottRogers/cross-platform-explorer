/// everyday filenames on Linux and macOS, where `dir/notes.` is a real distinct path and nothing is

/// change did not, and the result was that a macOS user moving a folder named `My Documents ` got an
/// error about Windows path normalisation and the move failed, while a Linux backup of `notes.` was

/// hazard that exists only on the third, and [`contained_under`] already covers the destructive case
