## Summary
Persist a chosen folder's checksum baseline (reusing the sha256 backend) and re-scan on demand, diffing via
CPE-790 to flag unexpected changes / missing files. Opt-in; no background scanning unless configured.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Baseline a folder (recursive sha256 + size + mtime) — backend `checksum_folder`. *(persist + verify-report is the frontend glue, slice 2 with CPE-792.)*
- [x] Opt-in; nothing scans unless the user baselines/verifies (IntegrityDialog only calls checksum_folder on click).
- [x] check + suite green (shipped on main).

## Notes
Prereq: CPE-790. Reuse the checksum backend; a scheduled verifier is a later follow-up.

## Work Log
2026-07-20 (nightshift restart) — Grep-first confirmed no recursive folder-checksum exists (only single-file
`hash_file`, CPE-412) — safe to build. **Slice 1 (backend) landed:** `checksum_folder(path) -> Vec<ChecksumEntry>`
in `lib.rs` — recursive sha256 + size + epoch-ms mtime per file, symlinks not followed, unreadable files
skipped, sorted by path (stable diff). Shape matches the CPE-790 `ChecksumEntry`. cargo test
`checksum_folder_hashes_files_recursively` (recursion, per-file hash match, size/mtime) passes; clippy
`--all-targets -D warnings` clean. Remaining (slice 2, pairs with CPE-792): frontend persist-baseline +
call `checksum_folder` + diff via CPE-790 `verifyManifest` + report.

2026-07-20 (nightshift restart) — **Deferred (status reconcile).** The headless backend slice (AC1,
`checksum_folder`) is done, merged, and CI-green; the entire remaining scope is the frontend
persist-baseline + verify-report glue that pairs with the integrity-report view. That's attended dev-app
GUI work, not a headless slice, so this doesn't belong in `Doing/` (it was left there after slice 1).
Moved to `Deferred/`.
- *deferred-on:* its frontend verify-report tail, which is CPE-792 (integrity-report-view) GUI work.
- *revisit-when:* picking up CPE-792 — persist the baseline manifest (app-data), call `checksum_folder`,
  diff via CPE-790 `verifyManifest`, and render the report there. No external gate; pickable anytime.

2026-07-21 — **Reconcile: DONE.** Confirmed the frontend glue (slice 2) is on main: IntegrityDialog does baseline + verify (verifyManifest → intact/edited/corrupted/missing/new) + rebaseline; App wires the palette command `tool.integrity`, persists baselines via settings.load/saveIntegrityBaselines, and handles rebaseline. All three children (790/791/792) complete. Moving Deferred → Done.
