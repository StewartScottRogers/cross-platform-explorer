// CPE-1951 — the publish side of "a release cut from an OLDER commit publishes a fully green
// catalog that every client silently refuses".
//
// CPE-1941 made each catalog entry's `version` the tagged commit's committer timestamp. Right
// number, and it made the version track **commit order, not release order**: tag a commit older
// than the last released one (a hotfix off a maintenance branch, a revert branch, `git tag` on a
// non-tip commit) and the number goes DOWN while the release job stays entirely green —
// `CATALOG_VERSION_FLOOR` is a *static* constant such a version clears by a mile, the future-date
// check passes, the signatures verify, the upload succeeds. Every client then answers
// `ApplyOutcome::Rollback`, writes nothing, and logs nothing.
//
// The client-and-disk half of that story is `sidecar/host/tests/catalog_offtip_release_lower_bound.rs`
// (it asserts on `ApplyOutcome` and on the manifest bytes, never on a verdict enum alone). THIS file
// is the publish half, in three layers, because each on its own has a known way to rot:
//
//   1. Structural, via `parseYaml`: `release.yml`'s `catalog` job really does run the guard, really
//      does feed it the derived version, really does run it BEFORE signing, and really does account
//      for its outcome. A regex over the raw file would be satisfied by a comment — and both this
//      workflow and the guard script are full of comments quoting the very strings a regex would
//      look for, so that failure mode is not hypothetical.
//   2. Derived, not claimed (CLAUDE.md): the URL the guard fetches is read out of `catalog_url()` in
//      `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` at run time, comments stripped, and compared against what the shipped
//      shell function actually prints. Change either side and this reds.
//   3. Executed: the real script is run against a real git fixture (three commits at controlled
//      committer dates) and stubbed `gh`/`curl`, once per failure mode, asserting the exit code AND
//      the distinct message. A guard whose failure paths were never executed is a provenance claim.
